title: ðŸ§¬ quantify transgenes and herv from 10x single-cell RNAseq
summary: The algorithm to quantify gene features used by common 10x single-cell RNAseq analysis cannot represent hERV which overlap frequently with genes. Here I discussed the algorithms for feature quantification, and successfully quantified hERV and transgenes by implementing the proper one
