title: ðŸ§¬ bulk-RNAseq allows transgenes, herv quantification
summary: The algorithm to quantify gene features used by common bulk-RNAseq cannot represent hERV which overlap frequently with genes. Here I discussed the algorithms for feature quantification, and successfully quantified hERV and transgenes by implementing the proper one
